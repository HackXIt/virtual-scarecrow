# virtual-scarecrow
This little shell script randomly plays one of the included raptor sound files.

It worked for a short while, until the prey figured that despite the alarming sounds of a nearby hunter, nothing was seen or happened.
So they ended up getting used to it.

But it was a fun mini-script either way.
